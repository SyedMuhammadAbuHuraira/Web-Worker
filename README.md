**Image Processing Tool using Web Worker**

**a. Brief Description:**

This project is a simple image processing tool that utilizes Web Workers to apply various filters to an input image. The tool is built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, allowing users to choose an image file, process it with different filters, and view the results. The use of Web Workers ensures that image processing operations occur in the background, preventing the main thread from becoming unresponsive during computation.

**b. Instructions to Run Locally:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-tool.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd image-processing-tool
   ```

3. **Open index.html in a Web Browser:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. **Choose Image and Process:**
   - Click the "Choose File" button to select an image.
   - Click the "Process Image" button to apply filters.

**c. Performance Improvements with Web Workers:**

Web Workers provide a significant performance improvement by offloading image processing tasks to a separate thread. This prevents the main thread, responsible for rendering the user interface, from being blocked during computations. Users experience a more responsive application, especially when dealing with large image files or computationally intensive filters.

**d. Challenges Faced and Solutions:**

- **Communication with Web Worker:**
  - **Challenge:** Communicating between the main thread and the Web Worker required understanding message passing.
  - **Solution:** Implemented a clear message-passing mechanism using the `postMessage` API for sending and receiving data between threads.

- **File Input Handling:**
  - **Challenge:** Handling file input and ensuring compatibility across browsers.
  - **Solution:** Utilized the `<input type="file">` element and checked for browser compatibility, ensuring a consistent file selection experience.

- **Filter Customization:**
  - **Challenge:** Providing a way for users to customize or add new filters.
  - **Solution:** Encouraged customization by allowing modification of the `applyFilter` function in the `script.js` file, providing examples of various filters.
